Project Instructions and Process
Dataset Identification and Source:

Identified a relevant dataset for analysis and verified the data source to ensure quality and reliability.
Problem Definition:

Defined a clear problem statement, setting up a hypothesis and formulating key questions to guide the analysis.
Data Preparation:

Dimension Analysis: Assessed the dataset's dimensions (rows and columns).
Attribute Details: Detailed the dataset attributes, including descriptions, data types, and general statistics like max, min, and average.
Missing Values: Identified and addressed missing values by imputing the mean.
Duplicate Values: Checked for and handled any duplicate values to maintain data integrity.
Outlier Detection: Generated boxplots to identify and analyze outliers.
Attribute Transformation:

Converted continuous attributes to categorical where necessary and applied binarization/discretization to specific categorical attributes.
Correlation Analysis:

Correlation Matrix: Generated a correlation matrix to explore relationships between attributes.
Heatmap Visualization: Created a heatmap to visually represent correlations, identifying key factors influencing performance metrics.
Classification Strategy:
